This is a sample of footnoted text[0].  It has quite a few footnotes[1],
but not as many as it might have.  The actual footnotes aren't included
below[2] because that's not part of this[3] exercise.

Speaking of which, did you hear the one about the bald[4] nun[5], the
left-handed Norwegian and the zebra with no stripes who walked[6] into a
bar[7]?  The barman[8] said, "This has to be the[9] stupidest[10] joke
I've ever been in."[11]
